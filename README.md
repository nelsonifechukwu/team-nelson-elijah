## About

Creating a Social Platform where anyone/everyone can read articles about health and personal hygiene and how to reach out to verified Health specialists/Consultant on their health matter at an affordable cost.
The spot light has always been on doctors but there are other health courses like Health Education Certified specialist has things, especially on hygiene and other things but are not employed, Sick people after seeing the doctor needs someone to take care of him in situations where he has no one
 Our App provides a platform on how Caregivers, health specialists and other can be posted and be self employed by posting their Articles and their consultant fee



## Why

The I-HealthAfrica is a Very Powerful Application aimed at transforming Black African's total life and well being. It also syncs well with lots of SDG(s) goal in the following ways
1. GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING - The application will the poor who do not have access to the hospital know how to take care of himself in several ways
2. NO POVERTY/ZERO HUNGER - It is said that your health is your wealth, Health Education being provided by the App will help in making the poor and rich save money that would have been spent un unnecessary health issues, and will also provide Job for the Jobless
3. QUALITY EDUCATION - Many in africa today are defrauded and engage in drug abuse due to poor health Education, we will curb that through our App
4. Clean Water and Sanitation - This is on topic that is pivotal in our App, teaching about hygiene
5. DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH - This is on topic that is pivotal to our App, We will be providing Job opportunity to courses that are dead in most part of our country, like Health Education Specialist will have major priority, Caregivers and more...
I believe this is the App for the Century
